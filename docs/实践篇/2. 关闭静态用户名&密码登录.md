# 关闭静态用户名&密码登录
默认用户casuser::Mellon是能够登录的，需要关闭掉。在 `application.yml` 中配置以下内容
```yaml
cas:
  authn:
    accept:
      enabled: false
```
如果未关闭，则CAS在启动时也会有以下提示：
```
CAS is configured to accept a static list of credentials for authentication. While this is generally useful for demo purposes, 
it is STRONGLY recommended that you DISABLE this authentication method by setting 'cas.authn.accept.enabled=false' and switch to a mode that is more suitable for production.>
```
